#### Major League 1995 - A React Baseball Simulator

##### Description
Major League 1995 - A React Baseball Simulator is a basic and fun web browser game that replicates a baseball game. The feel and look of the game will be that of a classic retro gaming console. 

##### Use Case
Users play the game. They will be Player 1 and will always face a computer. Baseball has a lot of interesting logic that will take some planning to achieve. The game will be loosely based on a dice based game called MLB Showdown. Essentially the user will press a “pitch” button. This button will put a few things in motion: 1) It will trigger a ‘randomizer’ algorithm or ‘roll the dice’ and based on this number it will give the user a few actions: strike, ball, out, hit 2) The program will calculate factors in the game. I.e. whose on base, how many outs there are. 3) There will be a scoreboard to keep track of a “game” object with key values: score, inning number. The purpose/goal of my project is to show off my understanding of JS/React Logic. It will also show a little of my styling skills with the ‘retro’ theme and will be interactive. Interactivity is something I am interested in furthering in my computer programming education. 

##### Minimum Viable Product
(List the absolute minimum features the project requires before it is considered in a pre-alpha state)
 * Creates a ‘game’ object with two players: one user, one cpu, 9 innings, 3 outs and inning, and a clear score board at 0-0 
 * The ability to ‘pitch’ the ball with multiple outcomes based on the this ‘dice roll’ algorythm
 * A text area that shows the actions of the game: ie, basehit to center field, strikeout +1 out, groundout +2 outs, etc. 
 * The ability to switch innings after 3 outs
 * The baseball players will be based on real players 
 * The ability to play a 9 inning game and the logic of a game ending at 9 innings if the score isn’t tied


##### Tools for MVP

 * VisualStudio Code
 * React 


##### Additional Features

 * Api - I am going to build my ‘player’ object similar to how this api is based so when I finish with the game logic and can implement: https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/
 * Firebase - a firebase component that allows a user to sign in, load game, see high scores, save game, etc.
 * React Native - look into React Native to see the possibility of turning this into a app 
 * React Redux - once my project is complete breaking it down into actions and reducers to show my knowledge


##### Tools for Additional Features

 * Api 
 * Firebase
 * React Native
 * React Redux

##### Additional Information

I am currently working on a basketball simulator. The github can be found here  https://github.com/jessecallahan/dream-team . I am kind of looking at these two as a pair. They both have a retro gaming feel and play on ‘90s themes. I am looking at the basketball app as a stepping stone to the slightly more complicated baseball simulator. The purpose of these two projects are really to show my knowledge and interest in JS/React logic. The ability to write non-mutatable handles and make an application that is interactive is an important part of what I would like to show a potential future employer.
